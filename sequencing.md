# Sequencing Overview
Often overlooked, knowing how to sequencing 2 minutes is key to reduce the amount of potential DPS bleed in terms of buffs. This is easier said than done. A core issue with your Div windows is that you physically cannot card buff everyone at the same time, someone has to lose out. Not only that we have other constraints such as Astrodyne, Divination and Minor Arcana. This is on top of Lightspeed being used 95% of cases as well.

The core of our 2 minute window starts with Divination, it must be used on-time or off cooldown as soon as possible. It's priority overrides everything in our kit, even cards. The second core is our Astrodyne, because playing cards give seals, +2:xx and +4:xx in the astrodyne cycles will be have us delaying play windows in order to get astrodyne out of the way, not adhering to this results in seal overcap which we generally want to avoid in 90% of situations.

## Routing
___
There are different ways to route your cards, depending on context some will be better than others.

- Forced DNC Priority
 <br/><br/>
Our goal in this routing is ensuring a specific DPS player gets a card on a specific play window while disregarding all other options beforehand. This is good for instances where there is only one clear option that bursts exponentially higher than other options at the time. DNC priority also has the added benefit of being fairly simple as you can treat it similarly to DRG Dragonsight or, DNC DP for one of your card plays - so good for beginner AST players. There are 2 pitfalls to this priority, first being RNG, you can't perfectly control what role type you get, the more rigid your priority, the more effect RNG has on it. 2nd being generally bad for DPS bleed, because your prioritising only one player with a perfect burst timing, your scuffing other play windows by collateral which can be extremely detrimental for your rDPS.

<br/><br/>
- Minimal Softloss via timelining
<br/><br/>
This routing is done by sacrificing parts of someone burst for bigger gains else where. This is different from Force DNC priority because our routing is a lot more static, meaning it's affected by RNG greatly - but a means to mitigate it is to have multiple card lines to adapt on the fly depending on the card drawn/redrawn. This greatly increases the difficult of AST.
<br/><br/>The best example is with NIN, SAM, DRK - we want do not want to buff DRK 1st because their burst does not start until 3rd GCD~ while we do not want to buff SAM or NIN too early either, DRK loses the most from scuffed card timings. Therefore our sequence will be: NIN > SAM > DRK, NIN 1st because we already can catch hyosho + TCJ so we're softlosing for TA, Bunshin + Phantom Kama. For SAM m2 we're softlosing for Yukikaze instead of a Gekko.
<br/><br/> While extremely versatile, it's often better suited for speedkill/log optimisations due to the added stress of sequencing on the AST's Div window. Generally not recommended for prog unless you specialise in AST, confident or have practised this type of sequencing.

<br/><br/>
- Fast Play
<br/><br/>
While not exactly a routing priority on it's own, its more or less a property that occurs when Lightspeed is not available for a 2 minute window, generally after a downtime phase such as TOP p2 reopener, DSR p6 reopener. It just means you cannot use redraws and you need to precard a player before you hit the boss.
<br/><br/>
You generally want to avoid this if possible, but the two situations mentioned are places where you cannot Lightspeed, either because it's on cooldown, or you cannot use it (because your saving it for another mechanic). Otherwise try to keep this as your last resort.
<br/><br/>
In the case for DSR, you get 2 instant casts from your DoT, by the time you get to your 3rd GCD you should have played all your cards and just playing out Astrodyne.
<br/><br/>For TOP P2 reopener you can potentially have 3 instance casts if you save the swiftcast from pantokrator.

<br/><br/>
- Balance Priority
<br/><br/>
It's only here due to it's prevelence on the Balance Discord. It's a simple 1 2 3 priority that generally works. But does not absolutely cover for every fight or the little details nor is it accurate. It's only good as a starting point similar to DNC Priority.
<br/><br/>
## Redraws
___

This oGCD while lets you potentially give you good seals or a preferred role type. It does shift your play window by either a weave slot (if Redraw into immediate play) or by entire GCD. With tight play windows, it can potentially cost you a big GCD because of it. For example if you want to m3 SAM on opener, but you draw an r3. Redrawing will mean losing a midare under card because you have to use Div as soon as possible, so it delays our play window even longer.

The first question that comes to mind is, *When do redraws become a DPS gain?*

Using the Astrodyne document as a basis, you should typically redraw when you stand to gain with little risk to dmging your own dmg. What do we mean by this? For example, if we drew a card that completes the 3rd unique seal, but its suboptimal role type, there is a 0% chance of redrawing a completed seal. Therefore redrawing here is a DPS loss unless the opposite role type (that has not have a card buff presently) can do 33%~ more damage than your 2nd choice.
