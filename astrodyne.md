# Astrodyne and You
Astrodyne is another factor we should worry about, a situation can occur when you saw a perfect role card, but not the correct seal. A choice will be potentially between completing seals with a suboptimal role card or buffing preferred class with unperfect astrodyne seals as of 6.2 you cannot "Clutch Redraw" which is when you Redraw a card that completes a perfect seal but suboptimal role card in an attempt to get both. While we can meme on AST aDPS contributions etc... one Astrodyne on it's own does not meaningfully contribute to your dmg, a collection of do.
<br/><br/>

A few definitions and rules:

Perfect Draw - unique seal + preferred role card type.

Perfect Seals - 3 unique seals for astrodyne

Optimal/preferred role card - your 1st choice player to buff within a given window.

Suboptimal role card - your 2nd choice player within a given window, usually they will not outburst your 1st choice

You get only 1 redraw, and you cannot redraw the same seal as the currently draw card.

Draw is completely random as of writing this doc.
<br/><br/>
## It's purpose?
___
The purpose of Astrodyne's existence is twofold: it's primary purpose is to add RNG as part of our class identity with randomly drawn card buffs(although all cards serve the same purpose) - this is based off the ShB system as the seals were introduced to prime your Divination. However getting 3 seals Divination were so important that people will wipe if the AST cannot get 3 seal Divs on time on top of getting decent card RNG - which is pretty much the same failure state of SB/HW AST of not being able to Draw balances for AoE buffs. The second purpose is to allievate RNG from affecting our rDPS, they changed it to only affecting our aDPS potential. Whether this was a good choice or not, it's out of this document and project scope.

We're here to play the hand we're dealt with of course.
<br/><br/>
## Why is this important?
___
Both your cards and astrodyne buffs are at very meagre gains. Meaning gaining and losing are done frequently and easily, without much of a thought. Astrodyne buffs do matter, depending on your card RNG as mentioned before. And as said before, gains are minimal when it comes to AST, but that's looking at an individual, singular instance. Within a general savage encounter, it'll between 3-5 Astrodynes and 12 and 20 cards roughly. In an ultimate, much, much, more....

Using this card line as an example. For context this is a Rank 1 p8s doorboos kill in 6.2

The AST is a good player. However in this run the AST loss 2k~ potency from card/astrodyne in terms of modified potencies.

This is mostly an approximation so the swing can be a little higher or lower.


However as said before in justframecards, there are different priorities that you can operate under, each has it's specific strength and context they're often used.
<br/><br/>

**Highroll:**

Everything is under the assumption of criting, we're taking mostly the account for absolute highend of dmg variance. Classes that already have built-in forced crits/dhits will be naturally lower on the ceiling because their potencies were balanced around criting/dhitting. WAR and MCH are the best examples to showcase this, IR fell cleaves, Inner Chaos, Reassembled Drill/Air Anchor/Chainsaw, etc... The major downside to this is the absurd luck required to get runs like this, and even so this kind of routing only applies to speedkills/log optimisations because your primarily fishing for god runs, both for yourself and the party. How this interacts with Astrodyne is almost disregarding the potential seal bonuses and only fishing for perfect seals and role cards.
<br/><br/>

**Average Rolling**

Your playing what you see. Burstlines are averaged out with their crit/dhit stat accounted for, not just the dmg increase but it's potential frequency. While not perfect since it's still inherently RNG, you can with some confidence predict how much a class will burst for through averages. Typically this should be your go to method as it can be applied pretty much anywhere. In prog settings, basic farms, etc... you get the idea. 
<br/><br/>

**Baseline**

Your playing for absolute minimum, never accounting for random crit chance. This is normally used on raidtiers with low crit substat gear, start of expac or generally parties with little crit stat. While to get a generate flatline of a burst's pure modified potencies/dmg. It will make classes with forced crit/dhit look better because their "modified potency" will look bigger as a result of their forced crit properties.
This does not occur very often. So you can kindly disregard this.
<br/><br/>



## As for Average/Baseline Rolling:
___
The correct choice tend to vary but is divided in to 2 categories:

**Your 1st choice player:**
1. If you draw perfect seal and optimal role card.
2. If you draw an imperfect seal, but optimal role card - *when the 1st choice's burst does 33%~ more dmg than your 2nd choice*
3. If your draw a seal that when played will be triple same seal but it's perfect role card. If you do gain a malefic from getting a 2nd unique seal from redraw then your 1st choice needs to at least 325p (250p base)than the 2nd choice. While yes you can redraw a 50/50 for 2 seals + perfect role card, it is a coinflip after all.

In this context it's usually a melee vs ranged, but can also be tank vs ranged depending on the card window. More specifically it'll be something like RDM vs NIN/SAM where the difference in burst is too great for Astrodyne to make up for suboptimal role card plays.
<br/><br/>

**2nd Choice player:**
1. If you draw a perfect seal but suboptimal card - *the 2nd choice needs to be around sub 33%~ dmg difference* which will allow Astrodyne's buff to make up more than it needs to.
2. If you draw a 2nd seal with suboptimal role card - the 2nd choice needs to be within 325p~ modified potency for unoptimal role card play to be worth it, that is asusming you gain a malefic from that Astrodyne in the first place.

 This is more prevenlent when your playing with more with comps that deal similar burst dmg. A good example would be MNK/DRG with SMN/DNC.
 
The reason this section exists is because purely playing for Astrodyne without consideration for the role type burst differences is a big pitfall - the opposite is also true, you cannot tunnel vision on role card type because you'll lose dmg from astrodyne. The best exmaple is in the log linked above. In the opener, the AST prioritised melee/tank in the opener to get triple seal Astrodyne, the burst difference between M3 GNB and M3 alt line BLM is too great for Astrodyne to make up alone (looking only in isolation).

 As said before it's obvious we  want perfect role card + perfect seals, but the chances for those are not common enough to factor in - and those are no brainers. So consider yourself lucky if you get this combination.
<br/><br/>
## Perfect Draws and Astrodyne
___
Astrodyne itself can be pretty easy to obtain on it's own. 6/6 For 1st seal, 6/6 for 2nd seal accounting for redraws. 3/6 For 3 unique seals including redraws. This may not seam that bad on the surface. The redraw change in 6.2 lets us unable to redraw a card of the same seal type as mentioned above.

However as said before:

- Class bursts are not made equal
- Astrodyne isn't that strong as advertised
- And so are your cards.

So if we want to include getting preferred roles on top getting unique seals?

3/6 to get 1st seal with prefered role + 3/6 x 2/4 for redraw into preferred role = 0.75 (3/4) chance

2/6 chance to get a 2nd unique seal with preferred role. As for redraws: if you drew the same seal as the 1st, then it's a 2/4 chance to obtain preferred role but 100% chance to get a unique seal - that is 2/6 x 2/4 = 4/24. 

However if you drew a unique seal but suboptimal card, there's a 1/4 chance of obtaining a unique seal + preferred role card. That's a 2/6 x 1/4 = 2/24 Chance of occuring.

So in total 2/6 from the initial draw + 4/24 from redraw with same seal + 2/24 from redraw with unique seal = 14/24 of drawing an optimal seal + preferred role card.

Lastly for 3rd seal. 
If we have 2 unique seals going in, it's a 1/6 Chance for unique seal + preferred role.
With redraws

There's a 1/6 chance we can softlock ourselves out of perfect draw

Drawing a previous seal with suboptimal role type, thats a 2/6 chance, then redraw into perfect draw, its a 1/4 - 2/24 Chance of this timeline occuring.

In total, 6/24 chance of getting a perfect draw, a 1/4 chance or 25%.

Getting a perfect drawn astrodyne, thats 18/24 x 14/24 x 6/24 = 1512/13824, approximately 10.9% chance of occurring for one astrodyne cycle. In a typical Savage fight, with 3 astrodyne cycles, 0.1% Chance of occurring.

Thing's really do not look that good on the surface. However, this is in consideration of highrolling priorities. Sometimes its not even worth going for.

When burst power is similar, or within range of each other - you can essentially just play for seal, because regardless of what you get, as long as you get a seal - it'll always be a DPS gain over perfect role type.
<br/><br/>

## 2nd vs 1st Slot Weaving
___
We usually want to 2nd slot weave our Astrodyne so that we get 7 GCDs or 8 if we're 2.34s recast. (This won't be a thing if Astrodyne operate from stacks instead of flat duration)

However some 2 minute windows it "may" not be possible. This occurs on any 2 minute window where we need to use Astrodyne inbetween card plays to prevent ourselves from overcapping.The problem here then becomes, is it worth delay a card play to get the optimal last GCD?

Delay gives you an extra 5% from malefic if it's perfect seal Astrodyne. But having just Haste will usually mean your 0.24~ slower from the norm.

If this results in a malefic cast being loss then it's a 250p loss. A straight 250p loss if it's 2.34 AST

So we're comparing:

**Delayed Play Burst + 2nd slot Astrodyne VS 1st slot Astrodyne + Fast Play Burst**

Either one can be optimal depending on who we are carding at those points.

## **How do we calculate Astrodyne Gain?**
___
With 2 seal astrodynes, it's merely a matter of gaining a malefic or not. This is however, sps dependent.

Crit focused builds will have around 7 malefics under astrodyne buff and most of them needed to be 2nd slot woven

At 2.34 GCD we always gain a Malefic if woven on the 2nd slot GCD (for a total of 8 Malefics)

2.35 GCD can have 8 malefics, but its inconsistent.

There may be downtime phasing or fight ends where you may lose a malefic if the accumulation of lost haste is great enough, either from 1st slot weaves or extremely bad astrodynes.

With perfect seals astrodyne its pretty easy

we just find out how much we gain from the 5% from our 7 or 8 malefics, and since we still get the haste buff we just add the earlier gains on top.

So a perfect seal astrodyn under 2.34 is essentially

250p x 1.05 = 262.5p

12.5p per malefic, 

12.5p*8 = 100p from the 5%

+250p from the extra malefic

we should also add earthly star dmg and lord of crowns dmg.

Star is 310p but because of pet potency its 0.95% of the actual potency = 294.5p

lord is 250p so 12.5p per lord = 25p from double lord

So the highest we can theortically get is

350p malefics

14.7p from buffing earthly star

25p from double lord

389.7p in total on a baseline only accounting for pet potency. Maim and mend only makes it 30% 
inflated.

With slow GCD speeds we don't need to account for the extra malefic. But we will want to account for it across the course of a fight at some point.


### If FFXIV was a simple game,

So with the gains from Astrodyne in mind.

To calculate if it's worth to complete the 3rd seal:

AstrodyneGain + 6% Secondary vs 6% Primary

However, that would make 2.34 the defacto build we want always no matter what our gear options are.

This fortunately is not the case

Crit/Dhit are factors we need to account for, even if they're inherently RNG by nature.

Comparing on average crit change to our astrodyneGains then compare that to average crit chances of our card targets. Now gains before more relative.

To be honest, I'm not sure how to showcase this, at least for now.
