# Astrodyne
Astrodyne is another factor we should worry about, a situation can occur when you saw a perfect role card, but not the correct seal.



## As for Average/Baseline Rolling:
The correct choice tend to vary but is divided in to 2 categories:

**Your 1st choice player:**
1. If you draw perfect seal and optimal role card.
2. If you draw an imperfect seal, but optimal role card - *when the 1st choice's burst does 33%~ more dmg than your 2nd choice*
3. If your draw a seal that when played will be triple same seal but it's perfect role card. If you do gain a malefic from getting a 2nd unique seal from redraw then your 1st choice needs to at least 325p (250p base)than the 2nd choice. While yes you can redraw a 50/50 for 2 seals + perfect role card, it is a coinflip after all.

In this context it's usually a melee vs ranged, but can also be tank vs ranged depending on the card window. More specifically it'll be something like RDM vs NIN/SAM where the difference in burst is too great for Astrodyne to make up for suboptimal role card plays.

**2nd Choice player:**
1. If you draw a perfect seal but suboptimal card - *the 2nd choice needs to be around sub 33%~ dmg difference* which will allow Astrodyne's buff to make up more than it needs to.
2. If you draw a 2nd seal with suboptimal role card - the 2nd choice needs to be within 325p~ modified potency for unoptimal role card play to be worth it, that is asusming you gain a malefic from that Astrodyne in the first place.

 This is more prevenlent when your playing with more with comps that deal similar burst dmg. A good example would be MNK/DRG with SMN/DNC. Obviously we want perfect role card + perfect seals, but the chances for those are not common enough to factor in - and those are no brainers

So consider yourself lucky if you get this combination.

3/6 or 1/2 chance to get 1st seal + prefered role

4/6 or 2/3 chance to get 2nd seal + prefered role

1/6 chance to get 3rd seal that's unique + prefered role

## **2nd Slot Weaving**
We usually want to 2nd slot weave our Astrodyne so that we get 7 GCDs or 8 if we're 2.34 recast. (This won't be a thing if Astrodyne operate from stacks instead of flat duration)

However some 2 minute windows it "may" not be possible.

This occurs on any 2 minute window where we need to use Astrodyne inbetween card plays to prevent ourselves from overcapping.

The problem here then becomes, is it worth delay a card play to get the optimal last GCD?

Delay gives you an extra 5% from malefic if it's perfect seal Astrodyne. But having just Haste will usually mean your 0.24~ slower from the norm.

If this results in a malefic cast being loss then it's a 250p loss. A straight 250p loss if it's 2.34 AST

So we're comparing:

**Delayed Play Burst + 2nd slot Astrodyne  VS 1st slot Astrodyne + Fast Play Burst**

Either one can be optimal depending on who we are carding at those points.

## **How do we calculate Astrodyne Gain?**

With 2 seal astrodynes, it's merely a matter of gaining a malefic or not. This is however, sps dependent.

Crit focused builds will have around 7 malefics under astrodyne buff and most of them needed to be 2nd slot woven

At 2.34 GCD we always gain a Malefic if woven on the 2nd slot GCD (for a total of 8 Malefics)

2.35 GCD can have 8 malefics, but its inconsistent.

There may be downtime phasing or fight ends where you may lose a malefic if the accumulation of lost haste is great enough, either from 1st slot weaves or extremely bad astrodynes.

With perfect seals astrodyne its pretty easy

we just find out how much we gain from the 5% from our 7 or 8 malefics, and since we still get the haste buff we just add the earlier gains on top.

So a perfect seal astrodyn under 2.34 is essentially

250p x 1.05 = 262.5p

12.5p per malefic, 

12.5p*8 = 100p from the 5%

+250p from the extra malefic

we should also add earthly star dmg and lord of crowns dmg.

Star is 310p but because of pet potency its 0.95% of the actual potency = 294.5p

lord is 250p so 12.5p per lord = 25p from double lord

So the highest we can theortically get is

350p malefics

14.7p from buffing earthly star

25p from double lord

389.7p in total on a baseline only accounting for pet potency. Maim and mend only makes it 30% 
inflated.

With slow GCD speeds we don't need to account for the extra malefic. But we will want to account for it across the course of a fight at some point.


### If FFXIV was a simple game,

So with the gains from Astrodyne in mind.

To calculate if it's worth to complete the 3rd seal:

AstrodyneGain + 6% Secondary vs 6% Primary

However, that would make 2.34 the defacto build we want always no matter what our gear options are.

This fortunately is not the case

Crit/Dhit are factors we need to account for, even if they're inherently RNG by nature.

Comparing on average crit change to our astrodyneGains then compare that to average crit chances of our card targets. Now gains before more relative.

To be honest, I'm not sure how to showcase this.
